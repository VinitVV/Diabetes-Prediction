# Diabetes Prediction


Diabetes is an increasingly growing health issue. If it is detected in time then through proper medical treatment, adverse effects can be prevented.
To help in early detection, modern technology can be used very reliably and efficiently.
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model for common people to predict whether they have diabetes or not, instantly right at home and that too cost free.

## Problem Statement

Diabetes is an increasingly growing health issue. If it is detected in time then through proper medical treatment, adverse effects can be prevented.
To help in early detection, modern technology can be used very reliably and efficiently.
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model for common people to predict whether they have diabetes or not, instantly right at home and that too cost free.

## Functionality

- The user just has to enter his/her testing parameters like Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Insulin levels, BMI, Age.
- The model analyses the data and determines whether the user is diabetic for not.

## Run Locally

Fork and clone the repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MeetMulik/Diabetes-Prediction.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Diabetes-Prediction-main
```

Start website using streamlit

```bash
  streamlit run website.py
```
